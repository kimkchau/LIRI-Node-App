# LIRI-Node-App

In this project, I have created LIRI.  LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface app.  LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data.  It uses the Spotify, Bands in Town, and the OMDB APIs and will send requests using the AXIOS package to the Bands in Town and OMDB APIs.
